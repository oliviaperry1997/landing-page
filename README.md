# landing-page

This is a practice projected created as part of the Foundations course
of The Orion Project, specifically the Flexbox section. I had some
getting the content in the header block to align in exactly the way I
wanted it to, and I'm still feel like there was a better way I could
have done it - but it does look like the reference image, and other
than that I had little trouble making everything look right.
